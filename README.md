I have worked on the dataframe basics, pandas and numpy project 
🚀 Getting Started with Data in Python: Pandas & NumPy Basics!

This week, I took my first step into the world of data manipulation using Python — and it’s been incredibly exciting to explore how real data can be handled efficiently with just a few lines of code.

📍 Here’s what I’ve learned so far:

🔹 Pandas:

How to create and explore a DataFrame

Checking shape, structure, and summary statistics using .shape, .info(), and .describe()

Adding new columns based on conditions (like assigning "Pass" or "Fail" based on marks)

🔹 NumPy:

Understanding 1D and 2D arrays

Accessing and slicing array elements

Using conditional logic like np.where() for fast evaluation

Performing basic numerical operations

💡 These tools are essential for anyone getting into data analysis, machine learning, or data science. They help transform raw data into structured insights – and I’m just getting started!

This learning process has shown me how powerful and simple Python can be when you’re working with the right libraries.

🎯 My goal is to keep learning, practicing, and eventually building real-world data projects.
